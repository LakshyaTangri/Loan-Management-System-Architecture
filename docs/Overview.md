# 01 - Architecture Overview

## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this architecture documentation is to provide a comprehensive, structured, and clear description of the Loan Management System (LMS). It serves as a single source of truth for all stakeholders, including business users, developers, operations teams, security teams, and auditors. The documentation aims to:

* Define the scope and boundaries of the LMS.
* Describe the various architectural layers (Business, Application, Technology) and their interdependencies.
* Detail the key components, services, and integration points.
* Highlight design principles, assumptions, risks, and compliance considerations.
* Facilitate effective communication, decision-making, and alignment across the organization.
* Support future system evolution, maintenance, and operational activities.

## 1.2 Scope

The scope of the Loan Management System (LMS) encompasses the full loan lifecycle, from initial application to final loan closure. It includes:

* **Loan Origination:** Capturing loan applications, identity verification, and initial data validation.
* **Credit Assessment:** Performing credit checks, affordability assessments, and risk scoring.
* **Loan Approval:** Facilitating decision-making by loan officers and automated approval processes.
* **Disbursement:** Managing the payout of approved loan funds.
* **Loan Servicing:** Handling scheduled payments, interest calculations, fee management, and balance inquiries.
* **Collections:** Managing overdue payments, dunning processes, and debt recovery.
* **Compliance & Reporting:** Ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, local financial regulations) and generating various operational and regulatory reports.
* **Integration with External Systems:** Seamless communication with credit bureaus, payment gateways, and core banking systems.

### 1.2.1 In-Scope Components

* Customer-facing Portal (Web and Mobile)
* Back-office Loan Officer Portal
* Automated Loan Processing Engine
* API Gateway for internal and external consumers
* Microservices for specific business functionalities (e.g., Credit Check, Payment Processing, Notification)
* Data storage solutions (relational and NoSQL)
* Messaging and event-driven integration services
* Authentication and Authorization services
* Monitoring, logging, and alerting infrastructure

### 1.2.2 Out-of-Scope Components

* Detailed infrastructure costs (though cost-efficiency is a design principle)
* Specific third-party vendor selection details (though integration points are considered)
* User training materials (though system usability is a design goal)
* Legacy systems not directly interacting with the LMS (unless specified as integration points)

## 1.3 Key Principles

The architecture adheres to the following key design principles:

* **Scalability:** Designed to handle increasing volumes of loan applications and users without performance degradation.
* **Resilience:** Built with high availability and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure continuous operation.
* **Security:** Implemented with robust security controls, data encryption, access management, and compliance with industry standards.
* **Modularity:** Composed of loosely coupled services and components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
* **Maintainability:** Easy to understand, modify, and troubleshoot.
* **Observability:** Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing capabilities for operational insights.
* **Cost Optimization:** Leveraging Azure services efficiently to minimize operational expenses.
* **Automation:** Automating deployment, testing, and operational tasks where possible.
