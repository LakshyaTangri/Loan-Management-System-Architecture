# Loan Management System (LMS) Architecture Documentation

This repository contains the comprehensive architectural documentation for the Loan Management System (LMS) deployed on Microsoft Azure. The architecture aligns with the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) and utilizes ArchiMate 3.0 for modeling.

## Project Overview

The Loan Management System (LMS) is a critical enterprise application designed to manage the full lifecycle of loans, from origination and application processing to disbursement, servicing, and collections. This system aims to streamline operations, enhance customer experience, ensure regulatory compliance, and provide robust reporting capabilities.

## Architectural Approach

Our architectural approach is guided by:
* **TOGAF ADM:** Following the phases of Business, Information Systems (Application and Data), and Technology Architectures to ensure a holistic and structured design process.
* **ArchiMate 3.0:** Using its modeling language to provide clear and unambiguous visual representations of the architecture across all layers.
* **Cloud-Native Principles:** Prioritizing scalability, resilience, cost-effectiveness, and security by leveraging Microsoft Azure's cloud services.
* **Modularity and Extensibility:** Designing components that are loosely coupled and easily extendable to accommodate future business requirements and technological advancements.
* **Security by Design:** Integrating security controls at every layer of the architecture, adhering to Azure security best practices.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to provide easy navigation through different aspects of the architecture:

* `docs/`: Contains detailed Markdown documents for each architectural layer and supporting information.
* `diagrams/`: Placeholder for ArchiMate diagrams in SVG format, visually representing the architecture.
* `.gitignore`: Standard Git ignore file.

## Modeling Guidance

The ArchiMate diagrams (to be generated externally and placed in the `diagrams/` folder) will visually model:

* **Business Layer:** Business actors (Customer, Loan Officer, Underwriter, Compliance Officer, Payment Gateway), business processes (Loan Application, Credit Check, Loan Approval, Disbursement, Loan Servicing, Collections, Compliance Reporting), and business services.
* **Application Layer:** Key application components (Customer Portal, Loan Processing Engine, API Gateway, Integration Services), specific Azure services hosting these (AKS, Azure Functions, Azure App Services), and their interfaces.
* **Technology Layer:** The underlying Azure infrastructure, including virtual networks, subnets, databases (Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB), messaging services (Azure Service Bus), security services (Azure Key Vault, Azure Active Directory), and monitoring tools (Azure Monitor).
* **Cross-layer Dependencies:** Explicitly showing traceability from business processes to the applications that support them and the technology infrastructure they run on.
* **Integration Points:** Visualizing integrations with external systems such as Credit Bureaus, Payment Gateways, and Core Banking Systems.

## Getting Started

To explore the architecture, navigate through the `docs/` folder. The `diagrams/` folder will contain the visual models.
