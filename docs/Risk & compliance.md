# 06 - Risks and Compliance

This section addresses key risks associated with the Loan Management System architecture and the measures taken to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and organizational policies.

## 6.1 Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk Category     | Risk Description                                                              | Mitigation Strategy                                                           |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Security** | Unauthorized access to sensitive customer financial data.                    | End-to-end encryption (data in transit & at rest), Azure Key Vault for secrets, Azure AD for access control, Network Security Groups (NSGs), Azure Private Link for database access. Regular security audits and penetration testing. |
| **Data Privacy** | Non-compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).             | Data residency controls (data stored in specified Azure regions), data anonymization/pseudonymization where appropriate, access logging and auditing, consent management implementation in Customer Portal. |
| **System Availability** | Outages due to single points of failure or infrastructure issues.          | High Availability (HA) design for all critical components (AKS, Azure SQL DB with zone redundancy), disaster recovery (DR) strategy across paired Azure regions, automated failover mechanisms, proactive monitoring with Azure Monitor. |
| **Performance Bottlenecks** | System slowdowns under high load during peak loan application periods.       | Scalable architecture using microservices (AKS auto-scaling, Azure Functions elasticity), load balancing (Azure Application Gateway), performance testing, and continuous monitoring. |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Failure to meet financial industry-specific regulations (e.g., AML, KYC).  | Implementation of automated compliance checks (e.g., for KYC during origination), detailed audit trails, role-based access control (RBAC), robust reporting capabilities, regular legal and compliance reviews of system features. |
| **Integration Failure** | Disruption of critical integrations with external systems (Credit Bureau, Payment Gateway). | Robust API error handling, circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, asynchronous messaging (Azure Service Bus), comprehensive monitoring of integration points, service level agreements (SLAs) with external providers. |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Over-reliance on specific Azure services making migration difficult.          | While leveraging PaaS for efficiency, design principles promote loose coupling between services. Microservices are containerized (AKS), allowing for potential portability. Data is stored in standard formats where possible. |
| **Cost Overruns** | Uncontrolled cloud resource consumption leading to unexpected costs.        | Regular cost optimization reviews, use of Azure Policy to enforce resource tagging for cost allocation, leveraging auto-scaling, right-sizing resources, and utilizing Azure Advisor for cost recommendations. |
| **Operational Complexity** | Managing a distributed microservices architecture can be complex.      | Automation of deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), centralized logging (Azure Log Analytics), comprehensive monitoring (Azure Monitor), robust alerting, and standardized operational procedures. |

## 6.2 Compliance Considerations

The LMS architecture is designed with the following compliance frameworks and considerations in mind:

* **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):**
    * **Data Residency:** Ensuring customer data is stored within specified geographic regions as per regulatory requirements.
    * **Data Subject Rights:** Support for data access, rectification, erasure ("right to be forgotten"), and portability through application features and underlying data management practices.
    * **Consent Management:** Mechanisms within the Customer Portal to obtain and manage user consent for data processing.
    * **Breach Notification:** Capabilities to log and report security incidents.
* **Know Your Customer (KYC) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Regulations:**
    * Integration with identity verification services and fraud detection systems.
    * Retention of audit trails for all transactions and decisions.
    * Reporting capabilities for suspicious activities.
* **Financial Industry Regulations:** Adherence to specific national or international financial regulations pertinent to lending and credit. This includes but is not limited to:
    * Fair lending practices.
    * Truth in Lending Act (TILA) / Consumer Credit Act.
    * Data accuracy and integrity for credit reporting.
* **Security Standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST):**
    * Implementation of security controls aligned with industry best practices for cloud environments.
    * Regular security assessments, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing.
    * Principle of least privilege applied to all access controls.
* **Operational Resilience:**
    * Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies.
    * Regular testing of backup and recovery procedures.

By proactively addressing these risks and compliance requirements, the LMS aims to operate securely, reliably, and in full adherence to legal and industry standards.
